# tgragnato/homebrew-tap

This is a custom Homebrew tap designed to provide access to formulae and software  that are not available in the official Homebrew repositories.

Currently, this tap is being used for:

-	Compiling a fork of aMule with opinionated patches that cannot be distributed upstream.
-	Building an updated version of Terraform, which Homebrew has declined to integrate due to license changes.
-	Installing Jekyll on the system without manual intervention via bundle and gem.
-	Distributing Magnetico, an autonomous (self-hosted) BitTorrent DHT search engine suite.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

```zsh

- Install Homebrew:
